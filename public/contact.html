<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>Hi! I am Akshat Dutta currently studying in Punjab Engineering College Chandigarh. I did my schooling from Mount Carmel School in Hoshiarpur which is my home town. 
  I enjoy playing guitar and consider myself a cinephile. I have also read some books, 'The Silent Patient' and 'Sharp Objects' being my favourite reads. I play badminton, cards and online games. I believe in the saying "Consistency is the key to success". I hope to keep on learning, travelling and spreading kindness.
